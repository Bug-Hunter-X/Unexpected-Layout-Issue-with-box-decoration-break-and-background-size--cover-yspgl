The solution replaces the problematic `box-decoration-break` property and relies solely on `background-size: cover` to manage the background image:

```css
div {
  background-image: url('image.png');
  background-size: cover;
  height: 200px;
}
```

This revised CSS code eliminates the unexpected layout behavior observed in the original code.  It ensures consistent rendering across different browsers by avoiding the combination of `box-decoration-break: clone;` and `background-size: cover;` that caused the rendering issues.  If you need multiline backgrounds, alternative techniques such as using multiple background images or other layout approaches should be considered.
