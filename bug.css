The following CSS code causes an unexpected layout issue in some browsers due to the use of an uncommon property and incorrect value combination:

```css
div {
  box-decoration-break: clone;
  background-image: url('image.png');
  background-size: cover;
  height: 200px;
}
```

The `box-decoration-break: clone;` property attempts to break the background image across multiple lines, but when coupled with `background-size: cover;` and a relatively small height, the image may not render correctly, resulting in unexpected clipping or distortion across different browsers.
